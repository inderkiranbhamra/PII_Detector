1. Importing Libraries
from flask import Flask, request, render_template
import re
import spacy
Flask: This is the main class from the Flask web framework used to create the web application.

request: It is used to handle HTTP requests in Flask.

render_template: This function is used to render HTML templates.

re: The re module is used for regular expression operations, which are employed here for pattern matching.

spacy: This library is used for natural language processing. The model en_core_web_sm is loaded for extracting named entities like names.

2. Initializing Flask and Spacy
app = Flask(__name__)
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
app: An instance of the Flask class is created.
nlp: An instance of the spaCy model for English language processing is loaded.
3. PII Detection Function
def extract_pii(text):
    # ... (PII extraction logic)
    return pii_detected
This function takes a text input and extracts various types of personally identifiable information (PII) such as Aadhaar numbers, Passport numbers, mobile numbers, email addresses, credit card numbers, social security numbers, driver's license numbers, names, and house addresses. The extracted PII is returned as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a detected PII entity.

4. Flask Routes
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html', result=None)
This route renders the main page of the web application, where users can input text for PII detection.

@app.route('/detect_pii', methods=['POST'])
def detect_pii():
    # ... (PII detection logic)
    return render_template('index.html', result=pii_detected)
This route handles the form submission, calls the extract_pii function to detect PII from the submitted text, and renders the result on the main page.

5. HTML Templates
Two HTML templates are used:

index.html: The main page template with a form for user input and an area to display PII detection results.
6. Running the Application
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
This block ensures that the Flask application is run when the script is executed directly.

Usage:
Users access the web application through a browser.
They input a paragraph of text into a form.
Upon form submission, the application processes the text using the extract_pii function.
The detected PII entities are displayed back to the user.
Note:
This is a simple example, and it's important to handle PII with care, following security and privacy best practices.
The application currently runs in debug mode (debug=True), which is suitable for development but should be disabled in production for security reasons.
